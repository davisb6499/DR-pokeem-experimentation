## what

i'm experimenting with [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) & [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) and am making this readme to ease my nerves about accidentally committing to master

## Who maintains the project? (i'm keeping this bc deleting credit feels icky)

The project was originally started by DizzyEgg alongside other contributors.

The project has now gotten larger and DizzyEgg is now maintaining the project as part of the ROM Hacking Hideout community. Some members of this community are taking on larger roles to help maintain the project.

### Please consider crediting the entire [list of contributors](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki/Credits) in your project, as they have all worked hard to develop this project :)
